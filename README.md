## UH Manoa Community Problem

_There isnâ€™t a consolidated place where all events on campus can be posted and viewed easily. Event postings are scattered across different media._

## Our Solution (Services)

Develop an application where students can both post and view events that are scheduled or happening on campus. 

To use the app, students and faculty need to login using their UH ID. They can then create events, view the number of people interested going, and view the events themselves. Users can create a schedule after selecting events they are interested in and view it in calendar form on their user page. Users would be responsible for managing their own events.

A more complete plan of the features we plan to implement can be found on this [page](https://dtokita.github.io/essays/final-project-idea.html).
