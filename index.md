## About What's Happening

##### UH Manoa Community Problem

There isnâ€™t a consolidated place where all events on campus can be posted and viewed easily. Event postings are scattered across different media. As a result, promoters have to work hard to get the word out, and consumers have to work hard to search for these events.

Here's an example:

Try finding the flyer for the film festival. It's not very obvious, is it?

##### The What's Happening Solution

An application where students can both post and view events that are scheduled or happening on campus.

Upon arrival to the site, you are created by the landing page below.

![Landing Page](images/landing-page.png)

Upon clicking `Find Out What's Happening`, you proceed to the homepage. 

![Homepage Example](images/homepage.png)

You are currently not logged in, and are only able to view the listings. To login, you click the `Account` item in the menu bar.

You now have the option of listing an event, saving an event to their profile, sharing an event, or filtering the events themselves. The difference is shown in the menu bar.

![Add Event Example](images/home-page-logged-in.png)

To add an event, you click `Add Event` in the menu bar.

To edit a listing you posted earlier, click `Edit Events` to take you to a list of your events (not yet made) or edit the event in your `My Events` page.

You can view your saved events by clicking `My Events`.

## Development History

The development process for What's Happening conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. Our project is broken into _Milestones_. Each Milestone consists of _issues_ which correspond to 2-3 day tasks.

##### Milestone 1: Mock-up Development

This milestone started on April 5, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a working landing page and several HTML pages to provide a mock-up of the pages in the system. The mock-up was created as a Meteor app, meaning that each page existed as a template and FlowRouter handled the routing to pages.

Mock-ups for the pages below were implemented during M1:

<img width="200px" src="images/edit-event-page.png"/>

<img width="200px" src="images/profile-page.png"/>

Milestone 1 was implemented as [What's Happening GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/meteor-mayhem/whats-happening-uhm/milestone/1).

Milestone 1 consists of six issues, and our progress was managed with the [What's Happening GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/whats-happening-uhm/projects/1)
