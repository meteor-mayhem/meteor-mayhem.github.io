## About What's Happening

### UH Manoa Community Problem

There isnâ€™t a consolidated place where all events on campus can be posted and viewed easily. Event postings are scattered across different media. As a result, promoters have to work hard to get the word out, and consumers have to work hard to search for these events.

Here's an example:

Try finding the flyer for the film festival. It's not very obvious, is it?

### The What's Happening Solution

An application where students can both post and view events that are scheduled or happening on campus.

Upon arrival to the site, you are created by the landing page below.

![Landing Page](images/landing-page.png)

Upon clicking `Find Out What's Happening`, you proceed to the homepage. 

![Homepage Example](images/home-page.png)

You are currently not logged in, and are only able to view the listings. To login, you click the `Account` item in the menu bar.

You now have the option of listing an event, saving an event to their profile, sharing an event, or filtering the events themselves. The difference is shown in the menu bar.

To add an event, you click `Add Event` in the menu bar.

You can view your saved and listed events by clicking `My Events`.

To edit a listing you posted earlier, edit the event in your `My Events` page.

Last but not least, visit the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you have an account of the UH test CAS server, you can login.

## Development History

The development process for What's Happening conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. Our project is broken into _Milestones_. Each Milestone consists of _issues_ which correspond to 2-3 day tasks.

### Milestone 1: Mock-up Development

This milestone started on April 5, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a working landing page and several HTML pages to provide a mock-up of the pages in the system. The mock-up was created as a Meteor app, meaning that each page existed as a template and FlowRouter handled the routing to pages.

Mock-ups for the pages below were implemented during M1:

<img width="200px" src="images/edit-event-page.png"/>

<img width="200px" src="images/profile-page.png"/>

Milestone 1 was implemented as [What's Happening GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/whats-happening-uhm/whats-happening-uhm/milestone/1).

Milestone 1 consists of six issues, and our progress was managed with the [What's Happening GitHub Project M1](https://github.com/whats-happening-uhm/whats-happening-uhm/projects/1)

![M1 Finished Milestone](images/m1-finished-project.png)

Each issue was implemented as its own branch, and merged into master when finished.

### Milestone 2: Authentication, Collection, and Google Maps Integration

This milestone started on April 13, 2017 and ended on April 27, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 2 is to integrate UH CAS authentication and Google Maps to our app, as well as create and tie Profile and Event collections into our UI. We also constructed two mockup pages for first time user setup and editing user's profile (interests, etc...), and updated the look of our current pages.

We updated our landing page to better inform the user what our app does. They can scroll down and see what events look like, modeled like how GitHub is.

Users will only be able to log in using their UH account by clicking the top left button in the menu bar, meaning that our users won't have to remember a new password to use our service. 

A mockup for the first-time user's page was created, as well as a similar edit-profile page. This will setup their interests, email, organizations, etc...

![](images/m2-user-setup.png)

A visually appealing location and date-time picker were added to the add-event and edit-event pages, but getting info from this was pushed back to M3.

A user can view their current profile and interests:

To store our events and profiles, the Events and Profiles collections were created. These hold everything associated with a given event and profile. 

To store the interests and organizations, we have global lists that hold each item. These are in separate files, but are exported when needed.

Milestone 2 is being implemented as [What's Happening GitHub Milestone M2](https://github.com/whats-happening-uhm/whats-happening-uhm/milestone/2).

Milestone 2 consists of several issues, and our progress is managed with the [What's Happening GitHub Project M2](https://github.com/whats-happening-uhm/whats-happening-uhm/projects/2)

Each issue was implemented as its own branch, and merged into master when finished.
